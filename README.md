# Magellan_Journey
This mini project is made by me and my classmates in Polytechnic University of the Philippines Taguig Branch under Bachelor of Science in Information Technology.
This project is a console-based program written in C++ using vs code, also the function of the code is based on file handling, gotoxy, and basic error handling.
The project is part of our final output as 1st year students so, we are glad to create a program like this and learn from it since we merge history in programming.
Thanks for my fellow member who helped me to such project like this. To God be the glory.
