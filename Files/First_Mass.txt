Philippine's First Mass

On March 31, 1521, an Easter Sunday, a Mass was celebrated
in the Philippines for the first time. It took place on
the island of Limasawa, which is located in the Visayas
region of the Philippines. The Mass was conducted by Father
Pedro de Valderrama, a priest who accompanied the Spanish
expedition led by Ferdinand Magellan.
The Mass marked the introduction of Roman Catholicism to
the Philippines. It was attended by Rajah Kolambu, the
chieftain of Limasawa, along with his wife and many of
their subjects. The Spanish expedition, which had arrived
in the Philippines a few weeks earlier, sought to spread
Christianity as part of their mission.
The First Mass in the Philippines is considered a
significant event as it marked the beginning of the
Spanish colonial influence and the eventual conversion of
the Filipino people to Catholicism. It laid the foundation
for the subsequent arrival of more Spanish missionaries
and the establishment of numerous churches throughout the
archipelago.
The First Mass in the Philippines holds cultural and
historical importance and continues to be commemorated in
the country. It is seen as a pivotal moment in the spread
of Christianity and the subsequent fusion of Spanish and
indigenous Filipino cultures, which have influenced various
aspects of Filipino society, including language, arts,
and customs.
