The Treaty of Tordesillas, signed on June 7, 1494,
divided the newly discovered lands of the Americas
between Spain and Portugal. The treaty established
a line of demarcation in the Atlantic Ocean, about
100 leagues west of the Cape Verde Islands, with
lands to the east claimed by Portugal and lands to
the west claimed by Spain. The treaty was adhered
to, with minor adjustments, and its consequences
are still evident today. Latin American nations
primarily speak Spanish due to Spanish colonization,
except for Brazil, which speaks Portuguese because
it fell east of the demarcation line. The treaty did
not consider the claims of other European powers that
emerged later. Importantly, the treaty overlooked the
existing indigenous communities in the Americas,
leading to devastating consequences for civilizations
like the Inca, Taino, and Aztec, among others.
