Enrique became a slave of Magellan when
the Portuguese conquered Malacca in
1511. He followed the latter back to
Lisbon, and was enlisted in Magellan's
fleet set to voyage around the earth
between 1519 and 1521. When Magellan
died during the Battle of Mactan, Cebu,
the Philippines in 1521, at the hand of
Lapu Lapu, some believe that Enrique
either settled down there or returned
to Malacca or Indonesia, since his name
was missing from the list of Magellan's
surviving crew returning to Spain.
