Magellan left Seville with 5 ships:
|the flagship Trinidad|
|San Antonio|
|Concepcion|
|Santiago|
|Victoria|

The San Antonio left the expedition after its
crew mutinied at Port San Julian in 1519. The
Santiago was wrecked as the fleet passed through
the Southern Tip of South America (Now known as
the Straits of Magellan). The Concepcion was
burned by the survivors of the Battle of Mactan
and the Ambush at Cebu off the coast of Bohol on
1 May 1521 as they were being pursued by the men
of Rajah Humabon.
The Trinidad, by this time under the command of
Gonzalo de Espinosa, was captured by the
Portuguese in the Mollucas as it attempted to make
its way back to Spain via the Pacific Route. Only
Victoria, under Juan Sebastian Elcano, completed
the journey with 18 surviving crew after they
successfully reached the port of Sanlucar de
Barrameda in Spain on 6 September 1522, almost 3
years since they began their world-changing
expedition.
