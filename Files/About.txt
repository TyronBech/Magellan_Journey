This console program is the proposed project
of the BSIT 1-1 students. This program shows the
information regarding the Magellan's Expedition
It uses basic user input functions, basic error
handling, file handlings and managing the text
during runtime. This program is not well developed
since it only run in the console and not advanced
as typical websites and applications. It only
uses terminal manipulation to output text and
opening the file.
