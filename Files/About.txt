Hello users!

This is the BSIT 1-1 who created the program. We
created a basic console-based program as part of
our final project in Computer Programming 2. This
Program is primarily dedicated to the Magellan's
Expedition which shaped the Philippines. The
program is mainly composed of files which can be
open by the help of file handling, also we put
restrictions to avoid errors by the help of error
handling. We also include a 3 random quiz compost
of 5 different questions to test if the user
remebers the topics he/she read. Overall to goal
of the program is to give short yet meaningful
information regarding Magellan's Expedition. We
hope you enjoy using our console-based program.
