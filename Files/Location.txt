Masao (Mazaua?) in Butuan:
The expedition reached Masao (possibly Mazaua) in Butuan on the
following day, where Magellan and Rajah Colambu established a
blood compact as a sign of friendship. On March 31, 1521,
Fr.Pedro de Valderrama conducted a mass, and a cross was
installed to symbolize the conquest of the land.

Mactan:
Lapu-lapu, the chief of Mactan, and Zula, another chief, opposed
the Spaniards. Magellan agreed to help Zula and fought against
Lapu-lapu on April 27, 1521. However, Magellan and his men were
overwhelmed and suffered heavy casualties. Magellan himself was
killed in the battle.

Island of Zamal (Samar):
On March 16, 1521, Magellan and his crew landed on the island of
Zamal, later known as Samar. They named the islands they saw as
the Archipelago of St. Lazarus, as their arrival coincided with
the Feast of St. Lazarus.

Homonhon:
They sailed from Zamal to Homonhon, where they encountered the
rulers of Butuan and Caraga, Rajah Siagu and Rajah Colambu.
They left Homonhon on March 27, 1521.

Cebu:
The crew sailed from Butuan to Cebu, where they met Rajah
Humabon on April 7, 1521. Despite initial reluctance, Humabon
welcomed Magellan, and they solidified their friendship through
a blood compact. On April 14, 1521, a mass was officiated in
Cebu, and a cross was erected as a symbol of conquest.
